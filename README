== Overview ==

These TM benchmarks generally requires the special version of GPGPU-Sim that
supports the __tbegin() and __tcommit() intrinsics.  You may also run the
non-TM version of the benchmarks on unmodified version of GPGPU-Sim and on
hardware GPUs.  

Notice that Cloth Simulation (CL in Kilo TM paper) is not available due to
licensing issues. 

== Compilation == 

To compile the benchmarks, all you need is to run at this directory: 

  make gputm

You may want to edit BINDIR inside path_setup.mk to define where the compiled
executables should be located. 

To clean the build, run:

  make clean_gputm

== List of benchmarks and commands to run them == 

Note: <data dir> is the sub-directory in each benchmark directory that contains
the data input for the benchmark. 

TM_Apriori2 (AP in Kilo TM paper): 
- Use the following command to run the benchmark 
  (run aprioriAtomic for the fine-grained lock version):
  aprioriTM -i <data dir>/data.ntrans_1.tlen_10.nitems_.5.npats_2000.patlen_6 -s0.0075 -n112 -x64

barneshut (BH in Kilo TM paper):
- Use the following command to run the benchmark 
  (remove -tm to run the fine-grained lock version):
  barneshut 30000 1 -tm 

cudaCuts (CC in Kilo TM paper): 
- Use the following command to run the benchmark 
  (run cudaCutsAtomic for the fine-grained lock version):
  cudaCutsTM <data dir>/flower3.txt

hashtable (HT in Kilo TM paper): 
- Use the following command to run the benchmark 
  (remove -tm to run the fine-grained lock version):
  hashtable -hashEntries=8192 -tm 
- For the low contention run, use 80000 for -hashEntries. 

interac (ATM in Kilo TM paper): 
- Use the following command to run the benchmark 
  (remove -tm to run the fine-grained lock version):
  interac -tm
